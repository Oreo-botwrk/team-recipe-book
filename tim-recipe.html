    <h1>Grilled Chicken Thighs w/ BBQ Sauce</h1>
    <h2>By: Tim Cole</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Boneless, skinless, chicken thighs (from 6-8 ounces)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
		<li>1/2 cup barbecue sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Prepare and season chicken. Pat the chicken Thighs dry using paper towels, using a small bowl, mix 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder,</li>
		
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil all over chicken thighs,</li>
		<li>then sprinkile the seasoning mixture evenly on both sides. Gently rub the seasoning into the chicken.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Heat up Grill: Preheat your outdoor grill to medium-high heat. If using a grill pan indoors, heat it over medium-high heat until it is hot and lightly smoking.</li>
        <li>A hot grill prevents sticking and helps create good grill marks.</li>
		<li>Step 3: Grill the chicken: Place the seasoned chicken thighs on the hot grill. Cook for 6-8 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and internal temp reaches 165 degrees farenheit (74 degrees celcius) </li>
		<li>The total cooking time will depend on the thickness of the chicken thighs. During the last 2-3 mins of grilling, brush chicken generously with 1/2 cup BBQ sauce on both sides, allowing it to caramelize (turn slightly sticky and browned) </li>
		<li>Step 4: Rest and serve. Once the chicken is cooked, take it off the grill and let it rest on a cutting board/plate for 5 mins. Resting allows juices to settle into the meat, keeping it tender and juice, then serve thighs immediately. </li>
		
    </ol>
    
    <p>Cooking time: 25-30 minutes (10 minutes prep-time, 15-20 minutes cook time) </p>
    <p>Serves: 2 people</p>
