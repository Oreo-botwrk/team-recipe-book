# 👩‍🍳 Team Recipe Book

Welcome to our Team Recipe Book — a collaborative collection of the meals, desserts, snacks, and chaotic kitchen experiments that keep us alive (and occasionally thriving).  
Every recipe in this repo has been tested, tweaked, and approved by someone on the team.

## 🥘 What This Project Is

This is a place where we:

- Document recipes we love or invented by accident
- Share cooking tips, ingredient notes, and variations
- Keep everything version-controlled so we never lose Grandmother’s legendary cookie recipe again

Each recipe is stored as a Markdown file and follows the same format for consistency.
